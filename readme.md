I can explain how the `renderWeather` function in your main.js module has access to variables returned by functions from the weather.js module. This is happening through a chain of function calls that pass data between modules.

Let's break down the flow:

1. In your main.js, you import the `getWeather` function from weather.js
2. You call `getWeather()` with some parameters, which returns a **Promise**
3. You chain `.then(renderWeather)` to handle the resolved Promise data

The key to understanding this is how Promises and the return values work:

### In weather.js:

1. `getWeather()` makes an API call using axios and returns a Promise
2. When the Promise resolves, it processes the data by calling three parser functions
3. It returns an object with three properties:
   ```javascript
   return {
     currentWeather: parseCurrentWeather(data),
     dailyWeaher: parseDailyWeather(data),
     hourlyWeather: parseHourlyWeather(data),
   };
   ```

### In main.js:

1. The resolved value from `getWeather()` (that object with three properties) becomes the input parameter to `renderWeather`
2. You destructure that parameter in the function signature:
   ```javascript
   function renderWeather({ currentWeather, dailyWeaher, hourlyWeather }) {
   ```
3. This gives you direct access to those three properties as variables inside `renderWeather()`
4. You then pass `currentWeather` to the `renderCurrentWeather()` function

This pattern is very common in modern JavaScript - it's leveraging:

1. **Module imports/exports** - Allowing you to use functions from other files
2. **Promise chaining** - Passing resolved values from one function to the next
3. **Object destructuring** - Breaking down objects into individual variables

The chain looks like:
```
getWeather() → returns Promise → 
Promise resolves with { currentWeather, dailyWeaher, hourlyWeather } →
renderWeather receives this object and destructures it →
renderCurrentWeather receives the currentWeather object
```


------------------------------------------------


I understand your confusion. Let me clarify how exactly the return value from `getWeather()` becomes the input parameter to `renderWeather()`.

This is happening because of how Promises and the `.then()` method work in JavaScript. Let's break it down step by step:

### How Promises and `.then()` Work

When you have a Promise chain like this:

```javascript
getWeather(49.2, 18.7, Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone)
  .then(renderWeather)
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
    alert("Error getting data");
  });
```

The `.then()` method takes a callback function as its argument. In your code, that callback is `renderWeather`. 

When the Promise from `getWeather()` resolves successfully:
1. JavaScript automatically passes the resolved value to the callback function provided in `.then()`
2. This happens implicitly - you don't have to explicitly write the code to pass the value

### What's Happening Under the Hood

Here's what's essentially happening behind the scenes:

```javascript
// This is what happens implicitly when your Promise resolves
getWeather(...).then(function(resolvedData) {
  renderWeather(resolvedData);
});
```

Where `resolvedData` is that object with three properties:
```javascript
{
  currentWeather: { ... },
  dailyWeaher: { ... },
  hourlyWeather: { ... }
}
```

So even though you're just writing `.then(renderWeather)`, JavaScript is automatically:
1. Taking the resolved value from `getWeather()`
2. Passing it as the first argument to `renderWeather()`

This is one of the powerful features of Promises in JavaScript - they allow you to chain operations where data flows from one step to the next without having to manually pass values between functions.

Does that help clarify how the data is flowing from `getWeather()` to `renderWeather()`?
